In my last post I described supervised learning as a machine learning method where the training set—which consists of input features and corresponding output targets—is fed into an algorithm. What happens after this? Does the algorithm just magically synthesize the information? That's what this post is about. Today, our goal is to understand machine learning in its simplest form.

# The Linear Regression Model
When the algorithm is provided with the training data, it produces a function, historically referred to as a _hypothesis_, which it uses to estimate an output for any given input. This function, also called a _model_, takes in a feature, $x$, and produces an estimate, $\hat{y}$. It is important to note the distinction between $x$ and $\hat{y}$:
- $y$ represents a _correct_ target value from the training set.
- $\hat{y}$ represents the estimated value predicted by the model.

A linear regression model is mathematically expressed as:
$$
f_{w,b}(x) = wx + b
$$
For simplicity, $f_{w,b}(x)$ is often written as $f(x)$. In the equation above:
- $w$ is the weight (or slope) of the model. It controls how much $y$ changes per unit change in $x$.
- $b$ is the bias (or intercept) of the model. It represents the value of $y$ when $x = 0$.

When the features and targets are plotted on a graph, the linear regression algorithm generates a _best-fit line_ with the aim of minimizing the difference between the predicted values and the actual values. The equation above represents that line.

This is an example of how linear regression can be applied: predicting house prices based on the size of the houses.

This is what the training set for this model would look like ($x$ in thousands of sq. ft, $y$ in thousands of $):
<div style="width: 30%; margin: auto;">
| $x$ |   $y$   |
|-----|---------|
| 1.0 |  300.0  |
| 2.0 |  500.0  |
| 3.0 |  580.0  |
| 4.0 |  830.0  |
| 5.0 |  900.0  |
| 6.0 | 1100.0  |
</div>

The form of linear regression is _one-variable_ or _univariate_ linear regression, which means there's a single feature for each data point. In the example it's possible to take other factors into consideration like number of bedrooms, location, etc.
